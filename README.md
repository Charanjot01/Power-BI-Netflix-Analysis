# Power-BI-Netflix-Analysis
### Introduction
Netflix has had phenomenal growth over the last decade in terms of the number of subscribers and revenue earned. The company has shown the ability to exceed the most ambitious revenue and subscribers projections time and time again. 

But the question is, what exactly is on Netflix? What kind of content do people appreciate so much that it enabled Netflix to be number one among online streaming platforms? This project analyses the content available on Netflix using Power BI Dashboard.

### Dataset
The analysis is based on the dataset obtained from Kaggle: Netflix Movies and TV Shows. Data includes information on the type (show or movie), title’s name, original release year, country of production, rating, genre, and a brief description of the title.

### Key Questions
•	Which content type dominates? Movies or TV Shows?

•	What is the trend of content addition since 2003?

•	Which countries create the most content?

•	What are the most loved genres among the audience for Movies and TV Shows?

•	Which rating is the most common for Movies and TV Shows?

### Creating the visualization
This was my ideation process for creating the dashboard:

•	My goal was to create a one-sheet dashboard that conveys the entire story.

•	I planned to create a few simple visualizations that would answer my questions.

### Findings
•	Interestingly 71.9% of the content on Netflix is movies. But the number of movies has been decreasing over the years whereas the number of TV shows is increasing. 

•	From 2003 to 2021, the number of movies added per year was greater than the TV Shows. Moreover, we can observe an intriguing uptick in the number of movies added in 2015 and 2019.

•	The United States accounts for the majority of the content created on Netflix for both Movies and TV Shows, with 2233 titles in total. India holds the second spot and creates movies majorly. Whereas the United Kingdom, Japan, and South Korea are in 3rd, 4th, and 5th position, respectively, and contribute to movies and TV Shows equally.

•	The most popular genre for movies is ‘International’ followed closely by ‘Documentaries’. Other popular genres involve Comedy, Drama, and Family movies. On the other hand, ‘Kid's TV Show’ is the most loved genre for TV Show content type followed by ‘Crime’ and ‘Comedy’.

•	Surprisingly, 31.64% of movies and 42.14 % of TV Shows on Netflix have a TV-MA rating which means that content is unsuitable for individuals under 17.
